/**
 * Example demonstrates use of application data and scenario prototype.
 * <p>
 * Human calls robot and robot asks questions.
 * Robot remembers answers (maintains state in application data).
 * Human doesn't maintain state, instead answer questions basing on question content.
 * Messaging inside dialog implemented using SIP MESSAGE.
 * In real world, instead of SIP messages it would be voice messages.
